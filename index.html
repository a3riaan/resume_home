    <h3>Summary of Events</h3>
    <p>
        The past several years, 15 or so, I have been spending my work time in a corporate environment.
        I have been focusing on ERP systems either functionaly, process designing, implementing, training or supporting
        the relevant ERP system and the various levels of business user or end user.
    </p>
    <p> There are many skills you aquire by working for a corporate entity, soft skills are very important, knowledge is equally important and 
        experience, which is gained either in your own capacity our through traditional training methods.
        One of these skills that changes you from just a number to a important number is your ability to
        take initiative in your work, be the self starter, be curious - why? how? who?
    </p>
    <p>
        This does not mean in any way that your growth will ever stop, and you should be concerned if it does. I can say that 
        during these past fifteen years, I have changed a lot in the way I think about specific problems, new chalanges and have slowly
        evolved my skills with experiance, some hard earned but truly invaluable to me.
